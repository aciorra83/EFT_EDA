Over the past year I've been playing Escape From Tarkov, the game is brutally unforgiving to new players and it's infamously known for a very steep learning curve. In addition to a steep learning curve and highly competitive community, the game is still in beta and for major patch updates the developers create what is known as a wipe. All player progress and inventory items are reset during a wipe and everyone starts over back at level 1. The most recent patch 12.12 at the time of this project, occurred on December 12th 2021. I wanted to examine my own gameplay and compare differenct aspects of my main(PMC) and secondary(SCAV) characters. I personally tracked this data in an excel document after each raid and conducted 75 for both my PMC and SCAV raids and then converted to a CSV file. This jupyter notebook conducts and exploratory data analysis utilizing Pandas and visualizations through matplotlib and seaborn to answer questions I had about my gameplay throughout these 150 raids.
